# What are we currently working on?
## Everyone:
   * Familiarize yourself with the [Source Code Management doc](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/wiki/(02)-GitHub-Source-Code-Management)
   * Per a new decision, all pull requests will need 6 approving reviews before they will be merged
   * Ongoing MVP development, refer to [this page](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/wiki/(01)-Minimum-Viable-Product-(MVP)-structure-for-World-War-of-Ants)
   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** Familiarize yourself with the layout of GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/projects), [Issues](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/issues), [Pull requests](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/pulls), and [Wiki](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/wiki)
## Mentors: 
   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** Make sure your fork is even with the development branch of the main repo

   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** Please edit [your assigned project](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/projects) with a link to the development branch of your fork. It doesn't matter who's fork, just pick one and stick with it.

   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** You'll have to add your co-mentors as collaborators to your fork so they can approve PRs and whatnot if you're not available. From your fork, go to Settings > Collaborators > type in the GitHub username for each of your co-mentors and click Add Collaborator. Each person you invite must then accept.

   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** DM your email to @stranger#4525 so I can allow you to edit the google task docs
   * ***(completed)*** ~~Veradux's PR #71 needs a few more approvals was merged to development branch, and then we will follow the [Source Code Management doc](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/wiki/(02)-GitHub-Source-Code-Management)~~
   * ***(completed)*** ~~Review necessary changes to team assignments once Vera's PR is merged (see pinned message in #team-general)~~
   * ***(updated)*** Ensure your projects have tasks/issues to work on (smaller MVP for tasks, expand task docs, pseudocode, IDE setup, GitHub tutorials, new ideas, etc.)
   * ***(updated)*** Communication: Make sure anyone who is interested in your task knows what needs to be worked on or what doesn't. Make sure they understand the forking/branching/cloning process. 
   * Make sure you are a member in the [Code Review](https://github.com/orgs/warofants/teams/code-review) team so that you can approve PRs. An administrator will have to add you. 
## Administrator: 
   * More transparency, so anyone can see what is being worked on at any time (hence this wiki)
   * Weekly "State of the Game" updates to @everyone on Sundays
   * GitHub administrator will assign Code Review team to Reviewers section of PR
   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** Change or remove existing team roles on discord to something else, currently TBD

# What are our next steps?

## Everyone:
   * Don't wait for your mentors to assign you tasks, everyone is on a different schedule. Eventually, when we are actually writing code, things will be more structured, but for now, see below...
      * Create a smaller [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for a task you're interested in
      * Create a smaller [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) for a task you're interested in
      * Write and share [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) for your ideas related to your task
      * Complete this [GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) on how to contribute to a project, and when you're done, think about what you will have to do differently for the WWA project ([hint](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/wiki/(02)-GitHub-Source-Code-Management))
   * ***(new: 28/8/2019)*** Once the project you wish to work on has a link to a mentor's development fork, you're free to clone that to your PC

## Mentors:
   * ~~Once we merge Vera's PR,~~ we need to decide if we're going to combine alextopher's PR into Vera's and decide how to go about that. Assign smaller tasks to all teams?
   * Decide what to do with all other PRs
   * ***(updated)*** Determine best course of action to break up big tasks into smaller tasks ([Issues](https://github.com/warofants/wwa/issues)) for individuals to work on
## Administrator:
   * ***(completed)*** ~~Team structure changes, will likely be combining some teams into larger teams. This accomplishes several things:~~
      * ~~Some tasks are now irrelevant after PR #71. Combining these teams re-aligns tasks throughout all teams.~~
      * ~~Some teams have a low active member base. Combining teams will create more active teams.~~
      * ~~Some mentors have little or no available time to spend on this project. Combing teams means more mentors per team.~~
   * Shift project focus from Discord to GitHub, and align all Google docs/resources within GitHub resources
   * We are currently on a 5-day free trial for a Trello power-up that auto-syncs all Trello tasks into the GitHub Issues board, and visa-versa. If this proves useful for the project, I will consider keeping it and paying for it.
   * Create a smaller "Code Review" team and reduce the number of necessary PR approvals
   * ***(completed)*** ~~Merge team assignment Google docs into each team's project or page on GitHub, give each mentor write access to original doc~~

# What have we completed?
* 12 coding teams with an average of 17 members each and 2-3 mentors on each, 230 total people
* 12 team assignments
* A web development team
* A senior management team
* A game design team
* A skills test to determine who would make a good code reviewer, mentor, or manager
* A source code management document
* A first draft MVP structure
* A first draft UML design
* Travis-ci and Codecov integration for automated testing
* Two huge architectural designs (see PR #69 and #71)
* PR #71 merge into development branch
