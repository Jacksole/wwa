# Queen Progression
* one responsible for the testOverview
* Progression mechanic for the queen. This will be the players method to fine tune their colony down the path of different stats. Consider it the research / upgrades system.

# Brainstorm
* "@Stranger: as the queen levels up, the colony's HP, food, resources, population, can all grow/expand (the pool gets larger)"
* Special for desert ants: can have multiple queen ants (more when colony’s resources are sufficient)
* Each ant species will have their own queen type. Starting queens for each ant species will be different from one another in terms of size(?), behaviour, mechanics(?), special global buffs for ants, etc. 
   * [Army ant queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_ant#Queen)
      * Dichthadiigyne trait (passive)
         * Increased ant production compared to other queens due to enlarged gaster size and an extended cylindrical abdomen.
         * Activates during night time
      * Phase shift (Active) 
         * Nomadic - Call all army ants to form a nest around the queen to defend. Can only be activated at night.
         * Stationary - Can be activated after a certain food quota is met. Ant production will be doubled over a short period of time.
# Queen Progression
## Experience Points
* You use experience points to level up general stats of the queen and her colony
   * Health
   * Attack
   * Defense (armor)
   * Egg production 
   * Growth speed
## Ability Points
* You use ability points to unlock different traits specific to your insect’s race
   * The [Formica rufa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_rufa) can gain the ability to spit acid and increase the acid’s damage by putting ability points into the skill/tech(?).
## Queen – Growth/ Molt System [Needs better name]
* The queen will grow at a rate based on how much food is eaten.  
   * Adjustable feeding rate or hunger bar (starving, hungry, satiated, full)
   * Each state could provide pros and cons [i.e. Full gives the max amount of growth but slows the queen down]
   * Only applies to the queen
## Spawn rate(?)
* Does the game ends when the queen ant dies ? if that is not the case , will there be a spawn point or spawn rate for the ant queen?
