# Species

* This could also be called the “immersion” team. Your job is to compile a list of stats by ant species. You may have noticed the other teams haven’t been told to use any sort of “strength multipliers” yet for the different tasks. It’s up to you to come up with which multipliers should exist AND work on balancing them. 
   * An attack bonus is the simplest example but what about unique livestock options 

# Starting ant species to choose from:
```
Army ants (Eciton)
Bullet ants
Giant Amazonian ants
Leaf Cutter ants
```

## Army Ant (AA)

* The most aggressive class in the game, will probably be a player favorite
* Must attack everything they encounter immediately, even entire colonies
* AA don’t fight other AA
* AA send massive columns of ants out to scour and immediately kill every insect or small vertebrae they encounter 
* AA can send scouts before attacking, this increases the AA colony’s chances of a successful invasion, if the scouts are not killed first!
* AA colonies must rest to recuperate the colony’s overall HP

## Bullet Ant (BA)

* 100% effective at repelling humans
* This ant is a predator of the glasswing butterfly. This butterfly attempts to combat Bullet ant by producing chemical extracts during the larval stage that are unpalatable to these ants. (maybe we make turn this into an active defense instead of passive?)
* The small phorid fly is a parasite of injured workers of Bullet ants, of which the supply is constant because frequent aggressive encounters occur between neighbouring colonies, resulting in maimed workers. The flies are able to parasitise healthy ants if the ants are artificially restrained, but healthy ants are agile and able to repel them. Army Ants must rest to regain HP and fend off phorid flies. Phorid flies will continually lower AA’s HP the longer the AA’s are not resting. 
* Sting is the strongest of all ants? (confirm if true IRL)

## Giant Amazonian Ants (GA)
* TBD

## Leafcutter ants (LC) 
* Highly effective at defending against AA, except for NomaEsen ants
* LC must enter “crisis mode” when they detect attacking ants
   * Crisis mode stops all other production, 100% of colony is on defense
   * The large soldiers swarm to sight of attack to create a front line
      * This front line should be effective against some AA species, but ineffective with NomaEsen
      * Has only 20% chance to stop NomaEsen
* LC (player) can choose to “fall back” and seal off nest entrances 
   * This increases odds of successful defense to 75%
* If NomaEsen successfully invades and steals brood, total LC pop is reduced by 80%, food, health, brood, and resources all reduced by 90%

### Other Ants


## NPC class: P. desertorum (desert ants)
* Effective defense against all army ant classes
* Spawned when player chooses an AA class
* Immediately evacuate nest when they notice army ants
* Carry as many larvae as they can in order to return and rebuild after attack
* High chance of ineffective invasion by player
## NPC class: P. obtusospinosa (square head ants)
* Spawned when player chooses an AA class
* Worker classes have big square heads
* Used to block entrances to nest when army ants show up
* Attackers give up after a while (high chance of repelling invasions from player)
## NPC class: Nomamyrmex Esenbeckii (“NomaEsen” for short, an AA class)
* The only species that can successfully eradicate a colony of leafcutters
* Should be spawned with player choose LC
