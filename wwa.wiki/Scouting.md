# Scouting

Think: *fog of war*, but for a text game. Later versions may be 2D to include a visible fog of war

* Player can send scouts out to find other colonies or resources, but these scouts are not player controlled, have RNG chance for success based on what the scouts encounter (for the first iteration). 
* Scouts will have a system that informs player of everything scouts find in a game world (food, resources, aggressors, colonies, etc)
* Include a system that allows the game to keep track of areas already scouted
* Player chooses what to pursue in game based on what the scout ants find up ahead (use RNG from a predetermined list of things)
* Aggressor classes can attack and kill scouts
