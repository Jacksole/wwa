# Forage
* Starting to develop the code for foraging resources.
* Will likely have to work with Scouting team to sync up
* For the start it should just be RNG based but moving forward it would be great to have a more incorrented(?) relationship with the scouting team’s 2d grid. Also think about “moving” resources closer to your base to improve the efficiency of collecting resources. 
* Ants could remember where certain resources are (pheromones) and the player could select a previously known site to gather resources from
* Army ant classes are always on the move, player chooses what to pursue in game based on what the scout ants find up ahead (use RNG from a predetermined list of things)
* Army ant classes cannot sustain forever by just foraging, must choose to skirmish, raid, or invade at some point in order to keep colony healthy
* Skirmishes with NPCs or Enemy carrying food.
